## Tech Stack

- Next.js 14 (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Supabase (Auth + Postgres)
- Tailwind CSS
- Chart.js for data visualization
- Holt-Winters forecasting algorithm

## Setup & Run

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fortnite-insight-dashboard.git
cd user-profile-app
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with your Supabase credentials:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=supabase_anon_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=supabase_service_role_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=localhost:3000
```

4. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Approach & Assumptions

The application uses Supabase for authentication and data persistence, with row-level security ensuring users can only access their own profile data. The Fortnite.gg data is fetched through a combination of web scraping and API endpoints, with the Holt-Winters forecasting algorithm providing accurate predictions for player counts.

The forecasting model accounts for seasonality (weekly patterns) and trend components, making it particularly suitable for Fortnite player data which often shows weekly patterns due to regular updates and events.

## Data Collection & Forecasting

The application collects Fortnite map statistics through a combination of:
- Direct API calls to Fortnite.gg endpoints:
  - `/player-count-graph` endpoint for historical data with customizable time ranges
  - Custom headers and referrers to mimic browser behavior
  - JSON response parsing for structured data access
- Web scraping techniques:
  - HTML parsing for real-time player counts using regex patterns
  - Extraction of internal map IDs from page elements
  - User-Agent spoofing to prevent blocking
- Data normalization and cleaning:
  - Daily peak aggregation from raw time series data
  - Timestamp conversion and date formatting
  - Handling of missing or invalid data points

The forecasting uses the Holt-Winters triple exponential smoothing algorithm, which:
- Models three components simultaneously:
  - Level: The baseline value of the series
  - Trend: The increasing or decreasing trend
  - Seasonality: Weekly patterns in player activity
- Implements multiplicative seasonality to handle varying seasonal effects
- Uses optimized smoothing parameters:
  - Alpha (Œ±) = 0.3 for level smoothing
  - Beta (Œ≤) = 0.1 for trend smoothing
  - Gamma (Œ≥) = 0.05 for seasonal smoothing
- Includes fallback mechanisms:
  - Naive forecasting when insufficient historical data is available
  - Season length of 7 days to capture weekly patterns
  - Automatic handling of edge cases and data gaps
- Provides 30-day forecasts with:
  - Daily granularity
  - Proper timestamp alignment
  - Formatted date labels
  - Continuous integration with historical data
